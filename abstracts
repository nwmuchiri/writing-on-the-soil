<p><span class="italic">Writing on the Soil</span> examines the metaphorical labor that land performs in novels, short stories, and drama from East Africa. This website complements my monograph.  .</p> 

<p> In the book, I argue that the region’s linguistic heritage (approximately several hundred languages) directly contributes to the allegorical variety with which land is dealt with in literature. In other words, although I focus on texts written in English, many of these authors are steeped in particular indigenous ways of knowing the land and of experiencing landscape. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, for instance, writes in Gĩkũyũ, Kiswahili, and English. Yvonne Owuor has incorporated Turkana land aesthetics into her 2014 novel, Dust. Okot P’Bitek’s lyrical poetry in Song of Lawino (1966) and Song of Ocol (1967) borrowed heavily from the Acholi language and the community’s interaction with its ecological surroundings. Because of this history, I situate the question of producing African scholarship in African languages as central. This is a debate that was best captured by the 1962 Makerere Conference which welcomed writers of English literature, but disinvited authors and poets publishing in Yoruba, Xhosa, Kiswahili, Amharic, Pidgin, etc. In the twenty-first century, what does it look like to use African languages in creating knowledge about the African continent?.<p> 

<p> My overall argument in this monograph—that representations of land and landscape perform significant metaphorical labor in African literatures—evolves across several geographical spaces. Each chapter’s analysis is grounded in a particular locale: western Kenya, colonial Tanganyika, post-independence Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Anam Ka’alakol (Lake Turkana), Kampala, and Kitgum in Northern Uganda. Moreover, each section contributes to a deeper understanding of the aesthetic choices that authors make when deploying tropes revolving around land, landscape, and the environment.<p> 

<br/>

<p><a id="ab2" class="small-caps-palatino bigger bold">Chapter One</a> &nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="smaller">top</a></p>

<p>In Chapter One, I demonstrate the aesthetic contradictions in fiction by Grace Ogot and Margaret Ogola. Ogot’s and Ogola’s novels straddle folklore—and its foregrounding of animal, plant, and supernatural life forms—as well as social realism—and its magnifying of human activity on land and landscape. I further pursue this aesthetic use of nonhuman life in Yvonne Vera’s and Alex Kanengoni’s non-linear narratives. </p> 

<br/>

<p><a id="ab3" class="small-caps-palatino bigger bold">Chapter Two</a> &nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="smaller">top</a></p>

<p>Chapter Two examines the examines the incorporation of mysticism and realism into a first-principles challenge of the very ontologies on which imperialism was founded.</p>

<br/>

<p><a id="ab4" class="small-caps-palatino bigger bold">Chapter Three</a> &nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="smaller">top</a></p>

<p>In chapter three, which focuses on the urban landscapes of Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I investigate how cit(y)zens strategically trespass and transgress. These self-conscious acts of disobedience are important substitutes for belonging—especially in colonial urban spaces that are singularly hostile towards their African residents. My discussion of publishing in African languages related to drama and fiction from Tanzania and Ethiopia, respectively. </p>

<br/>

<p><a id="ab5" class="small-caps-palatino bigger bold">Chapter Four</a> &nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="smaller">top</a></p>

<p>Chapter Four expounds on the fraught relationship between artists and ruling regimes, especially in regards to use of literary tropes derived from landscapes. </p>

<br/>

<p><a id="ab6" class="small-caps-palatino bigger bold">Chapter Five</a> &nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="smaller">top</a></p>

<p>Chapter Five, on Yvonne Owuor and Monica Arac de Nyeko, explores how ecology and humanity influence each other. Owuor and Nyeko transform topographical features into allegories of their characters’ psychological landscapes.  Finally, the chapter on Yvonne Owuor and Monica Arac de Nyeko explores how ecology and humanity influence each other. Owuor and Nyeko transform topographical features into allegories of their characters’ psychological landscapes. .</p>
